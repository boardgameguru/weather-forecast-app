This is my first attempt of building an app using AngularJS. I am following a project provided by Anthony Alicea in his Learn AngularJS Udemy course.

This uses AngularJS v1.3 and Bootstrap to create the basis for the application.

This app will allow you to type in a city name and upon clicking a button will take you to a forecast page. This will display the weather forecast for the current weather or next 24, 48 or 72 hours, depending on what the user selects.
